Outstanding:
Move compiler and data manager to separate repos
Change saving to BPS or similar
Exclude and specify moves (i.e. don't include thick fat or other non-randomizable ones and give them to specific pokes)
Effects replacement framework (i.e. call for family fixing/generation)

Reformat code - create style file for repo
Add tool tips for implemented interface items
Comment functions

re-evaluate seed distribution - only needed if one change won't affect another (i.e. a different move pool)
Try to make generic for force number of attacks (i.e. don't assume one)
