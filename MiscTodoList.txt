Outstanding:
Specify moves (Allow setting call for family to a specific poke)
	Check that exclude is working for both cases...
Move compiler and data manager to separate repos
Change saving to BPS or similar
Effects replacement framework (i.e. call for family fixing/generation)

Reformat code - create style file for repo
Add tool tips for implemented interface items
Comment functions
add user guide for editing config files

re-evaluate seed distribution - only needed if one change won't affect another (i.e. a different move pool)
Try to make generic for force number of attacks (i.e. don't assume one)
