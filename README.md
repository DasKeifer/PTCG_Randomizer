# The Pokemon Trading Card Game Randomizer
A randomizer in the works for the pokemon trading card game. No official release yet as I'm still setting up infrastructure to support all the planned features to make things go smoother in the future.

## Backstory
I recently got into randomizers for Pokemon mainline games. I've always loved the PTCG on GBC so I looked for a randomizer for it but didn't find any with a  wide breadth of options so I decided to tackle the challenge myself.

Its a project of love for me so I'm not sure when updates and fixes will come out.

## Planned and Completed Features (in rough priority order)
Some notes on terminology:

*Shuffle* - All items are pooled together and selected and removed from the pool. If the pool is empty, it will be reset. Each item will be used once before an item is used a second time </br>
*Randomize* - All items are pooled together and randomly chosen from. Items may be used many times or not at all
